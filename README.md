  This repository contains a three parts whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis pipeline.
  This was developped in the context of never smoker lung cancer study of tumor mutationnal burden (TMB).
  1. NSLC-TMB-WGS-Pipeline: variant calling and annotation of WGS data.
  2. NSLC-TMB-Cutoff-Survival: estimating TMB, establishing the associated cutoff in never smokers and survival analysis.
  3. NSLC-TMB-ProgressionModel: optimizing the genome regions for TMB estimation to predict survival of never smokers with lung cancer using feature selection methods.

First and second parts of this pipeline were published:
